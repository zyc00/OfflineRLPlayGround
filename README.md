## Offline RL Playground

### Targets
Figure how offline modules work on different settings.
1. IQL: compare SARSA, IQL, GAE with on-policy, offpolicy data, different dataset size, and different modality (state, image and point cloud)
2. What rule does policy play in real world RL? Deterministic vs stochastic, exploration vs exploitation
